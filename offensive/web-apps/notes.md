## HTTP
HTTP is an unencrypted hyper text transfer protocol. This means that all the information that is sent between you and the http server is in plain text. Anyone who would capture the packets could read the forms data. For example if you login on a http page this means you send your credentials in plain text. This can be easily used if someone would capture this packet. 

### HTTP Request
Everytime you try to reach a certain website through your browser.
